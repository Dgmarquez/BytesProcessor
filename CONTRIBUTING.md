## Key Areas of Contribution

Here are some points and features we're particularly interested in. If you're looking for a place to start, these are some areas that could use your help:

- **Port Filtering Logic**: Enhance the utility by adding logic to filter specific ports.

- **Support for pcapng**: While we currently use `dpkt` as our parser, we're open to suggestions on integrating other parsers that can more efficiently handle pcapng files.

- **Extended Protocol Support**: The versatility of BytesProcessor can be increased by adding support for more protocols.
